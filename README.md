# My_zuri_project_phase_contributions

Good ['morning','afternoon','evening']

I entered zuri as a fullstack developer but contributed to the frontend only, we had four frontend developers im my team
I was assigned three task to perform which i did

The team lead created a branch in our team's repository so as to avoid merge conflicts, we the developers forked the repository then submit a  pull request of our 
contributions to the develop branch.The team lead will then merge them and push to the master branch.
